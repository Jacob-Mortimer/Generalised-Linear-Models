This respository contains my university dissertation on applications of generalised linear models alongside a complementary Tableau dashboard. There were issues regarding uploading the file to Tableau Public due to errors extracting shapefiles. Additionally, a .twbx file exceeded the github limit so I have left a video showcasing the interactive dashboard if you can't view the Tableau files. https://youtu.be/OaUXvdQXR24
